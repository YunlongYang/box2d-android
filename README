This JNI implementation of the Box2D physics library is extracted from
the libgdx game framework.

The transformation is performed by the perl script import.pl.  It copies
all relevant files out of libgdx and also automatically changes the
package names from 'com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d' to simply 'box2d'.
The libgdx implementation of Box2D pulls in some data structures from
libgdx itself (Vector2, LongMap etc.).  Those files and their
dependencies are also moved over to the box2d package.

No code changes are made to the Box2D JNI implementation itself.  The
full credit goes to the developers at libgdx.  This libBox2d library is
merely a convenience library that I have built in order to use it as a
replacement for JBox2D without pulling too much stuff I don't care for
from libgdx.
